Hi **{}**, I'm **IDNCoderX Unzipper Bot** 😇!

**How To Extract? 🤔**
`1. Send the file or link that you want to extract.`
`2. Click on extract button (If you sent a link use "Url Extract" button. If it's a file just use "File Extract" button).`

**How To Change Upload Mode? 🤔**
 `Send` **/mode** `command to the bot. You can change upload mode from there.`
 
**Note:**
    **1.** `If your archive is password protected select` **(Password) Extract 📂** `mode. Bot isn't a GOD to know your file's password so If this happens just send that password!`
    
    **2.** `Please don't send corrupted files! If you sent a one by a mistake just send` **/clean** `command!`
    
    **3.** `If your archive have 95 or more files in it then bot can't show all of extracted files to select from. So in that case if you can't see your file in the buttons just click on` "Upload All ♻️" `button. It'll send all extracted files to you!`
